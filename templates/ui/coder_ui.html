        <div id="textContainerFaq">
            <p id="1" class="textTitle">1. What are ‘Reliability’, ‘Validity’ and ‘Quality’?</p>
            <p class="textBody">The purpose of SQP is to provide information regarding the quality of survey questions. The quality of a survey question is defined as the strength between the latent concept of interest and the observed response to the measure or survey question. In order to determine the quality of survey questions, the sources of measurement errors have to first be determined. A first source of measurement error is ‘Random error’. Random measurement errors are due to unintended and unpredictable mistakes by either the respondents when choosing the right answer, the interviewers when reporting the answer given by the respondent or the data coders when coding the responses into the database. Thus, if one were able to ask the same question several times, people would not give the same answer and the coders would not code the answers in the same way. So the responses of respondents contain random measurement errors.</p>
			<p class="textBody">A second source of measurement error is the way people react to the different ways of formulating a survey question, for example the response may be different for a question depending on whether a categorical scale with 5 points or an 11-point scale is used, because people may react differently to the different formulations. Some respondents usually give extreme answers to an 11-point scale while others do not use the most extreme responses. On the other hand, both groups of respondents may use the 5-point scale in the same way (Saris and Gallhofer, 2014). This source of measurement errors is named ‘Method effect’ or ‘Systematic error’.</p>
			<p class="textBody">Finally, the third source of measurement error appears when a question does not perfectly cover the concept of interest that is intended to be measured. Imagine the situation in which we want the complex concept “Job satisfaction” to be measured and for that the following survey question: “Would you choose the same job if you could choose again?” is used. Although the question used is probably a good reflection of the complex concept that it intends to evaluate, namely the satisfaction with the respondent's current job, he could for instance, consider in his response not only the satisfaction with his current job but also the satisfaction he may have had with other possible jobs. This suggests that there is a difference, which is called a ‘Unique component’, between the complex concept to be measured and the simple concept measured by the question. Figure 1 indicates where these different errors can play a role.</p>
			<img src="/media/img/sqp/faq/FAQ1_Figure.png" class="imgFaq4">
			<p class="textBody  caption">Figure 1: The true score model with measurement errors</p>
			<p class="textBody">The observed variable (Y) contains the responses to a specific survey question. As illustrated in Figure 1, this observed variable also contains random errors (e). Therefore, the latent true score for this observed variable (TS) can be defined as the observed variables minus the random errors. The strength between the true score and the observed variable is the reliability (r<sup>2</sup>) of the question. The larger the contribution of the true score to the observed score, the higher the reliability of the question. ‘Reliability’ can thus be formulated as:</p>
			<p class="textBody idented">Reliability (r<sup>2</sup>) = 1 – proportion random error in the observed variance</p>
			<p class="textBody">Because all survey questions are formulated in a specific way, the true score is partially affected by the variable the question is supposed to measure (i.e. the simple concept of interest) and partially by the reaction of the respondents to the method used (i.e. the method effect). In other words, the latent simple concept of interest can be defined as the latent true score minus the method effect, simply called ‘Method error variance’. The strength between the simple concept of interest and the true score is the validity (v<sup>2</sup>) of the question. ‘Validity’ can be formulated as:</p>
			<p class="textBody idented">Validity (v<sup>2</sup>) = 1 – proportion method error variance in the true score variance</p>
			<p class="textBody">Up to this point it could be said that by removing the method effects from the true scores, the scores obtained would represent the concept that the question was supposed to measure. However, as said before, this simple concept may not perfectly represent the complex concept the researcher intends to measure. It may be that these two differ due to unique components. This last part of the measurement process is not taken into account by the SQP quality prediction. The quality prediction given by SQP only refers to simple concepts. The evaluation of the quality of complex concepts requires more research and analysis (Saris and Gallhofer, 2014 and DeCastellarnau and Saris, 2014).</p>

			<p class="textBody">The above definition of ‘Reliability’ is the same as in the literature in general, but the definition of the validity is different because some authors call ‘Construct validity’ the product of the SQP definitions of validity and the reliability (Andrews, 1984). Others define the ‘Validity’ as the relationship between the complex concept of interest and the observed variable. SQP prefers using the concepts “Reliability” and “Validity” as defined above and call the product of these two the ‘Quality’ of a survey question. </p>
			<p class="textBody idented">Quality (q<sup>2</sup>) = reliability (r<sup>2</sup>) x validity (v<sup>2</sup>)</p>
			<p class="textBody">The quality indicators of survey questions, reliability and validity, are estimated by the so-called Multitrait-Multimethod (MTMM) experiments, where different traits (i.e. simple concepts) are measured with different methods (i.e. different formulations of survey questions). The basic model used for the estimation of the relationships between the simple concept of interest, the true score and the observed variable is presented in Figure 1, where the effects between these variables are represented by the ‘Reliability coefficient’ (r) and the ‘Validity coefficient’ (v), which squared provide respectively the estimates of the ‘Reliability’ and the ‘Validity’. For details of the procedures, go to Saris and Gallhofer (2014).</p>
			<p class="textBody">In the quality output of SQP, two different values are given for each measure. The squared values (r<sup>2</sup>, v<sup>2</sup> and q<sup>2</sup>) represent the predictions of the ‘Reliability’, ‘Validity’ and ‘Quality’; while r, v and q represent the ‘Reliability coefficient’, the ‘Validity coefficient’ and the ‘Quality coefficient’. </p>
			<p class="textBody">In this general definition, it is assumed that the variables of interest are continuous, while often the observed variables are measured in a limited number of categories. If that is the case, the ‘Reliability’ is also affected by the so-called ‘Categorization errors’ (Saris, Van Wijk and Scherpenzeel, 1998). In such a case, the ‘Reliability’ will be not only affected by ‘Random error’ but also by ‘Categorization error’.</p>
			<p class="textBody idented">Reliability (r<sup>2</sup>) = 1 – variance of random and categorization errors</p>
			<p class="textBody">Besides being measures of the strength of a survey question, reliability and validity can also be used to correct for measurement errors (Saris and Gallhofer, 2014 and DeCastellarnau and Saris, 2014). </p>
			

            <p id="2" class="textTitle">2. What is the distinction between MTMM quality estimates and SQP quality predictions?</p>
            <p class="textBody">In the current SQP database of questions, it can easily be detected whether this information is available or not because of the following icons:</p>
            <p class="textBody idented"><img src="/media/img/ui/m.png"> Indicates that MTMM quality estimate is available</p>
			<p class="textBody idented"><img src="/media/img/ui/u1.png"> and <img src="/media/img/ui/a.png"> Indicate that a SQP quality prediction is available </p>
            <p class="textBody">The Multitrait-Multimethod (MTMM) quality estimates are the result of factor analysis of MTMM experiments and are provided in SQP for those questions in the database which were involved in an MTMM experiment.  </p>
            <p class="textBody">SQP was developed using a meta-analysis of the results (i.e. quality estimates) of multiple MTMM experiments and the information regarding the characteristics of the questions involved in those experiments (Oberski et al., 2011). Thus, the SQP quality predictions are the result of this meta-analysis and are provided in SQP for the questions in the database for which the characteristics have been coded using the SQP coding system. Moreover, the SQP quality predictions can be provided for any new survey question in the database after coding its characteristics.  </p>
            <p class="textBody">In general, the MTMM estimates and SQP quality predictions are quite close (R<sup>2</sup> is rather high). However, occasionally the two can differ from each other. Taking into account that the quality estimates obtained through MTMM experiments are the result of a one point in time analysis, and given that the SQP predictions are based on the results of many of these analyses, in general, the SQP quality prediction is a more reliable result than the MTMM estimates. There are only two cases in which reliance on the MTMM estimates over the SQP predictions would be suggested: </p>
            <p class="textBody idented">1) Because ‘Agree – Disagree’ (AD) scales cannot be identified yet in the SQP characteristics (see Limit 4). Thus, although it has been demonstrated that the quality of ‘Item-Specific’ (IS) scales is much higher than AD scales (Saris et al., 2010), SQP would not be able to distinguish both. </p>
            <p class="textBody idented">2) The SQP predictions are based on the general trends of the relationships between the different characteristics of the MTMM questions and the MTMM quality estimates of these questions in all countries. Thus, if a question in a country deviates considerably from these general trends the MTMM estimates should be preferred.  </p>
           

            <p id="3" class="textTitle">3. What is the distinction between ‘Authorized predictions’ and ‘Other user predictions’?</p>

            <p class="textBody">SQP provides ‘Authorized predictions’, which can be identified by the icon <img src="/media/img/ui/a.png"> and the other user predictions, which can be identified by the icon  <img src="/media/img/ui/u1.png">. This distinction is made to indicate the difference between the results obtained by a controlled and supervised coding procedure and an uncontrolled and unsupervised coding procedure of the characteristics. The ‘Authorized predictions’ can be trusted because they have been coded in the different languages by native coders under the training and supervision of the SQP team. If the question of interest is coded but not authorized, it is recommended that the coding be checked before using the predictions.</p>
            
            <p id="4" class="textTitle">4. For which countries is SQP able to provide a quality prediction?</p>
            <p class="textBody">SQP is able to provide quality predictions for the countries involved in the MTMM experiments, since these experiments are the ones used in the meta-analysis. The countries for which the current version of SQP can give a prediction are the following:</p>
            <p class="textBody" style="font-weight: bold">Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and United States.</p>
            <p class="textBody">The basic idea behind SQP is that the quality of a question can be predicted on the basis of the topic of the question, the formulation of the question, the response scale, the mode of data collection, etc. In the formulation of the question, many linguistic characteristics have been included to cope with the language differences. However, these characteristics are not sufficient to cover all differences in qualities across all countries, as estimated in the MTMM experiments. Therefore, a country variable was introduced to cover other effects related to the reaction patterns in the different countries. As a consequence, SQP cannot predict the quality of questions for countries that are not included in the above list.</p>
            <p class="textBody">In other words, from the MTMM estimates included in SQP, only the effect of the country can be identified directly with the selection of the country. The SQP quality predictions include the effect of the language through the effects of the linguistic characteristics. Thus, the SQP quality predictions are available for the above-listed countries in combination with any language (see FAQ 2 for the distinction between MTMM estimates and SQP predictions). For example, supposing users want to study immigration in the Netherlands. For the Spanish immigrants, the Spanish language could be used in combination with the Dutch country. This combination will cover the cultural effect of living in the Netherlands and the linguistic characteristics will capture the effect of the question’s language. </p>
            <p class="textBody">It is important to note that the effect of the country variable is in general very small. Therefore, if one wished to obtain a prediction of a question in a country which is not on the list, it would be advisable to choose a ‘Prediction country’ (see FAQ 5 for the description of ‘Prediction country’) that is culturally similar to the country of interest.</p>
            <!-- -------------------------------- -->
            <p id="5" class="textTitle">5. How do I code the Don’t know option?</p>
            <p class="textBody">There are three options to deal with the Don’t know option in a question. The first is to explicitly provide it to the respondent, in this way the don’t know option will be treated as another answer option and will be present in SQP text. However, many studies apply the implicit don’t know option, which is not mentioned to the respondent as an answer option but can be chosen by the interviewer if the respondent does not know how to answer. In this case, it will not appear in the SQP text, however, the coder must code this characteristic as “Don’t know option only registered”. The third case in when the answer options are provided with no don’t know option.</p>

            <p id="6" class="textTitle">6. How do I code the Interviewer instructions?</p>
            <p class="textBody">The characteristic Interviewer instruction is only present if an interviewer is reading the questionnaire to the respondent. These instructions are not present in SQP because they are not read to the respondent. However, if an interviewer administrated the survey the coder must check the presence of this kind of instructions in the questionnaire.</p>

            <p id="7" class="textTitle">7. How do I code the Show Cards characteristics?</p>
            <p class="textBody">The Showcard characteristics will imply an interviewer instruction regarding the use of a show card for a question. It will not appear in the SQP text but if a Show card was used the coder will need to code its characteristics (i.e. horizontal or vertical scale, picture provided, numbers or letters before answer options, etc…).</p>

            <p class="textBody linkTab">In this section the current limits of SQP software version will be summarized.</p>
            <p class="textBody linkTab">SQP was developed using the data from more than 250 Multitrait – Multimethod (MTMM) experiments carried out in the first 3 Rounds of the European Social Survey (<a>ESS</a>) and 87 experiments carried out by other research agencies (Saris and Gallhofer, <a>2007</a>). These experiments resulted in a database of 3,726 survey questions for which the quality was known. Based on this database of questions, the MTMM quality estimates could be related to the formal and linguistic characteristics of the questions and a meta-analysis was developed, which allows the quality of new survey questions to be predicted. SQP is software used to obtain quality predictions of new survey questions (Saris and Gallhofer, <a>2014</a>). The kind of survey questions for which SQP can provide a reliable prediction, is limited to the type of questions involved in the MTMM experiments. Here, these limits will be specified.</p>
			<p class="textBody linkTab">The SQP team expects most of these limits to be improved in a new version of SQP. In the meantime, please be aware of the limits and take them into account before reaching any conclusions.</p>

            <p id="1" class="textTitle">1. Countries for which SQP can give a quality prediction</p>
            <p class="textBody">SQP is able to provide quality predictions for the countries involved in the MTMM experiments, since these experiments are the ones used in the meta-analysis. The countries for which the current version of SQP can give a prediction are the following:</p>
            <p class="textBody" style="font-weight: bold">Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and United States.</p>
            <p class="textBody">The basic idea behind SQP is that the quality of a question can be predicted on the basis of the topic of the question, the formulation of the question, the response scale, the mode of data collection, etc. In the formulation of the question many linguistic characteristics have been included to cope with the language differences. However, these characteristics are not enough to cover all differences in quality across countries as estimated in the MTMM experiments. Therefore, a country variable was introduced to cover other effects related to the reaction patterns in the different countries. As a consequence, SQP in principle, cannot predict the quality of questions for countries that are not included in the above list.</p>
            <p class="textBody">In other words, from the MTMM estimates included in SQP, only the effect of the country can be identified directly with the selection of the country. The SQP quality predictions include the effect of the language through the effects of the linguistic characteristics. Thus, the SQP quality predictions are available for the above listed countries in combination with any language (see FAQ 2 for the distinction between MTMM estimates and SQP predictions). For example, let’s suppose users want to study immigration in the Netherlands. For the Spanish immigrants they could use the Spanish language in combination with the Dutch country. This combination will cover the cultural effect of living in the Netherlands and the linguistic characteristics will capture the effect of the question’s language. </p>
            <p class="textBody">It is important to note that the effect of the country variable is in general marginal. Therefore, if users would like to obtain a prediction of a question in a country which is not on the list, it is recommended that a country is chosen for the prediction that is culturally similar to the country of interest (see FAQ 5 for how to use a ‘Prediction country’). In that case, the amount of uncertainty regarding the correctness of the predictions increases and this should also be taken into account. Thus, if possible, users should try using different prediction countries. For example, for a country such as Canada there are several countries that could be used, namely United States, Ireland and United Kingdom for those English-speaking questions, while France, Belgium and Switzerland, could be used for those French-speaking questions. The decision will depend on whether the prediction country is most similar in terms of cultural characteristics to the Canadian sample population. Users will not obtain a different prediction by simply choosing a different country in SQP. Users need to create and code the questions as many times as necessary to compare the results (see Limit 2).</p>
            
            <p id="2" class="textTitle">2. The ‘Country’ characteristic</p>
            <p class="textBody">As explained in Limit 1, the characteristic ‘Country’ of a survey question coded in SQP has an effect on the quality of this survey question. This means that having the same formal and linguistic characteristics of a question for different countries does not imply that the quality prediction of these would be equal, as the quality is affected by the country in question.</p>
            <p class="textBody">With the current SQP version, to detect the effect the country has on the quality, users need to code the characteristics of the questions separately for the different countries. Thus, if for example, a user codes the formal and linguistic characteristics of a question for a particular country (e.g. United Kingdom) a quality prediction for this particular country and characteristics will be given. However, if the user decides to identify the impact of having selected the United States and not the United Kingdom for instance, without any change in the formal and linguistic characteristics, the user should add the same question in SQP selecting, this time, the country United States and coding the same formal and linguistic characteristics. By editing the United Kingdom question details and changing the characteristic ‘Country’ to United States, SQP will not be able to recalculate the quality prediction. </p>
            <p class="textBody">In other words, if users would like to know the quality of the same question but in different countries, users need to add and code the characteristics of the question for each country.</p>
            
            <p id="3" class="textTitle">3. Topics of the questions</p>
            <p class="textBody">It is impossible to perform MTMM experiments for every question in survey research. Additionally, it is difficult to formulate alternative forms of some survey questions. Moreover, for background variables, memory effects could be present if different question alternatives were designed for the experiments. Background variables can also contain measurement errors as has been shown by Alwin (2007), using Quasi Simplex models, and Schröder (2014), using scaling procedures and latent variable models. Although the current version of SQP would not be a good source of quality information for these types of questions, quality information regarding background variables is available in Alwin (2007).</p>
            <p class="textBody">Combining the SQP predictions and the estimates of Alwin (2007) with respect to background variables, the estimates of a very large number of topics used in social sciences can be obtained and therefore the correlations between all variables can also be corrected from measurement errors. </p>
            
            <p id="4" class="textTitle">4. Absence of an ‘Agree-Disagree’ (AD) characteristic</p>
            <p class="textBody">The classic decomposition of the question-answering process has four components: 1) comprehension of the item, 2) retrieval of relevant information, 3) use of that information to make required judgments and 4) selection and reporting of an answer (Tourangeau, Rips and Rasinski, 2000). However, many authors state that ‘Agree-Disagree’ (AD) questions require an extra effort by respondents to answer the question (e.g. Carpenter and Just, 1975; Clark and Clark, 1977; Trabasso, Rollins, and Shaughnessy, 1971). The response process would be composed in the following way: (1) the respondents must read the stem and understand its literal meaning; (2) they must look deeper into the question to discern the underlying dimension of interest to the researcher; (3) having identified this dimension, respondents must then place themselves on the scale of interest; then, (4) they must translate this judgement into the AD response options appropriately, depending upon the valence of the stem. Although Saris et al. (2010) have shown that the distinction between AD and ‘Item-Specific’ (IS) requests is a very important one, meaning that the quality is affected greatly depending whether an AD or an IS request is used, the current version of SQP does not distinguish explicitly between ‘Agree-Disagree’ (AD) requests and other requests. </p>
            <p class="textBody">Furthermore, Revilla, Saris and Krosnick (2013) have also shown that for AD scales the quality decreases when the number of scale points increases, whereas in general the quality increases with the number of points. For SQP users, this means that:</p>
			<ui>
				<li><p class="textBody idented">SQP probably tends to overestimate the quality of questions using an AD request.</p>
				<li><p class="textBody idented">Users should not trust the predicted effect of the number of scale points on the quality for AD requests.</p>
			</ui>
			<p class="textBody">For instance, if a 5-point AD scale is evaluated and the ‘Potential improvements’ tool suggests that increasing the number of points to 11 would improve the quality, then users should not do that, users should stick to the 5-points (Revilla, Saris and Krosnick, 2013) or even better, switch to an IS scale (Saris et al., 2010).</p>
            <p class="textBody">In addition, whenever users are interested in evaluating such questions, as the one presented below, it is recommend that they code them as ‘Complex concepts’.</p>
